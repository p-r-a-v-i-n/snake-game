# üêç Classic Snake Game ‚Äì HTML5 Canvas & JavaScript

A simple recreation of the classic Snake game using HTML5 `<canvas>` and vanilla JavaScript.

This project is designed as a learning exercise to deepen understanding of:

- How the `<canvas>` element works in the browser
- Coordinate systems in HTML canvas
- Low-level JavaScript without libraries or frameworks
- Real-time input handling and basic game animation

---

## Project Goals

This project aims to:

- Practice working directly with canvas API
- Learn how drawing and updating canvas elements works
- Understand browser-based coordinate systems
- Use keyboard input to control game elements
- Implement game loops using `setInterval`.
- Practicing low-level JavaScript without libraries or frameworks.

---

## Understanding Coordinates

The coordinate system starts from the **top-left corner** (0,0). 
- The `x` coordinate increases to the right.
- The `y` coordinate increases downward.
All positions and dimensions are in pixels.

1. **Clone** or [download](https://github.com/p-r-a-v-i-n/snake-game) this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
3. Use your **keyboard arrow keys** to control the snake.

No build tools, frameworks, or installation steps required.
